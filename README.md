# Data-Encryption-on-Removable-Media
Data Security is a major issue which we are facing today in this digital world of communication. Data protection can be accomplished by changing the original data to appear as cipher text. In this project we will do our best to develop an offline software running on external storage devices  which can perform the intended tasks, and at the same time it will be very friendly to the users and will not require special skills to learn about using our developed software. In this application the user must select either he wants to store something by encryption or wants to use by decryption. If they are not encrypted, there is a high risk of exposing the sensitive information to unauthorized people. Therefore, we believe that the data shall be encrypted, especially when they contain sensitive or personally identifiable information. On the other hand, some data protection regulations like the GDPR or HIPAA are mandatory to follow if you are a business or a company user. According to them, you will have to pay costly fines if your data is not encrypted.
Even if these regulations do not constrain you, it is still vital to encrypt your external storage devices to prevent data breaches that could cause severe damage to your company
